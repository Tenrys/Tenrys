<!-- # Hi there!

My name is **Marceau Maubert**, however I am most commonly known online as **Bell**, or **Tenrys**. I am a passion-driven jack-of-all-trades developer, learning the basics of programming in middle school at the age of 13, by practicing [video game modding](https://garrysmod.com) making use of [Lua](https://lua.org), taking part in a [community](https://metastruct.net) I still circle around today, and to which I owe a lot of patience.

Nowadays, I am primarily focused on **Web Development**, keeping up to date with the latest trends and learning more and more each day, striving to adopt  and integrate the best practices, to continue improving my performance writing clean, readable, maintainable and fast code, so that I can help create great things, such as tools, libraries, scripts, websites, or any kind of interactive experience.

When I am not busy working on something, I like to play games with friends, watch anime and simply hang out with others. Outside of that, I am a big fan of everything cute, game/anime related art, and varying genres of music.

Happy to make your acquaintance, feel free to check me out on my other profiles below, and maybe get in touch! :)
